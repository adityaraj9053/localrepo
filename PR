#Merging code using PR i.e. pull request.
it let us tell other about changes we have pushed .

merge git pe hone ke karan vscode pe koi changes not shown. for sgowing changes 
"git pull origin <name of subfile>"

#resolving merge conflict:
Ex: 1) adding "This is a new feature (button)" in main file.
Ex: 2) adding "This is a new feature (dropdown)" in feature1 file.

on merging, there a conflict arise which one we want to save.
vscode will give some suggetion, if we want to save both, we write both the lines. If want single then, remove other.
And iske liye hm PR ka nhi merge code ka use krte h.
